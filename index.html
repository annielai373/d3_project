              <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks in Relation to Poverty, Household Income, Age, Obesity, and Smoking.</h2>
              <p>In the United States, 2014 data suggests that certain demographics coorelate to a level of health risks depending on residing state. 
                With respect to level of poverty, those having healthcare (in other words, lowest percent in lacking healthcare) at 4.6%, resided in the state of Massachusetts with 11.6% poverty.  
                Whereas, those who were at greatest health risk, lacking healthcare at (24.9%), resided in the state of Texas with 17.2% poverty level. 
                In relation to median household income, the lowest ($39,680) was reported in Mississippi with a moderately high 18.8% that lack healthcare.  
                In contrast, the highest ($73,971) was reported in Maryland with a low 9.2% healthcare index.</p>

              <p>There is a positive coorelation among those who lack healthcare and the level of poverty. In contrast, there is an inverse relationship with those who lack healthcare and the amount of median household income.</p>
